                    I am a Computing Science student at Simon Fraser University with a strong passion for both game and web development.
                    They are very fascinating to me as I enjoy being challenged but also enjoy the feeling of solving these challenges which is a unique and exciting experience.
                    I find being able to complete a project and being able to reflect on it is also an amazing feeling.
                    I strive to continue learning and build more projects to always continue enhance my skills and push my abilities further.
